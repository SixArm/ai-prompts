## General help prompts

**Inspiration**:

The user's input is inspiration, not instruction.

**Guide**:

Treat the userâ€™s input as a conceptual guide, not a directive.

**Historical Genesis Prompt**:

Explain [concept] by starting with the original problem that made it necessary. What were people trying to solve? What failed attempts came before? How did the solution evolve from these early struggles?

**First Principles Reconstruction**:

Break down [concept] to its most fundamental assumptions. If I knew nothing about this field, what basic truths would I need to accept? Now build up the concept step by step using only these foundations.

**The Feynman Deconstruction**:

Explain [concept] as if I'm 12 years old, but don't lose any of the essential depth. What analogies capture the core mechanism? Where do these analogies break down, and what does that teach us?

**Visual Intuition Builder**:

Help me see [concept] rather than just understand it. What's the geometric interpretation? How would you animate or visualize the key insight? What would I literally see happening?

**The 'Why This Way?' Probe**:

Why is [concept] structured exactly as it is? What would happen if we changed each key component? What constraints forced it into this particular form?
