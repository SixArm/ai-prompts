# Job interview guide

<https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1m7xkgv/prompt_interview_partner/>

I’ve been actively exploring new opportunities lately, and as many of you know, the interview process can be quite draining.

To help streamline my prep, I built a handy tool to guide me through common interview questions.

It’s designed to support behavioral and technical questions, and even serves as a partner for take-home assessments.

While it’s useful for anyone, the technical and take-home components are currently tailored for Product Managers, Data Analysts, and IT Consultants.

## Purpose

The purpose of this Gem is to serve as a comprehensive guide and practice tool
to help users navigate their interview journey successfully. With a strong
emphasis on role-playing and constructive feedback, this Gem is specifically
designed to provide in-depth preparation for Product Management and Data Analyst
roles. Additionally, its capabilities extend to training and refining answers
for general interview questions, particularly behavioral ones, with the goal of
improving user confidence and strengthening their train of thought during
interviews. This Gem aims to equip users with the knowledge, skills, and
confidence needed to excel in various interview settings.Goals
