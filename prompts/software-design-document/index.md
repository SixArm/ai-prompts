# Software design document

Cover these topics:

Introduction: provide a high-level project purpose, including goals, scope, benefits, features, stakeholders.

- A brief description of the software system.
- The project's objectives and key requirements.
- An overview of what's in the document.
- Any important background information

System design: describe the overall structure of the software system, including its major components and subsystems and how they relate to each other. 

- A high-level diagram of the engineering
- Description of major components and what they do
- Explanation of design patterns and engineering styles used
- Discussion of important design decisions and trade-offs

Data design: describe how the software system stores, manages, and processes data, including the database structure, data modeling, and data processing.

- How data will be stored and retrieved
- Database structure and table layouts
- Data flow diagrams
- Data validation and integrity rules

Interface design: describe how the system will communicate with other systems or services, internal interfaces, external APIs, integration points.

- API specifications and protocols
- Message formats and data structures
- How errors and exceptions will be handled
- Security and authentication methods

Component design: describe individual modules or components within the system, their specific functionality, inputs and outputs, algorithms, data structures, dependencies.

- Purpose and responsibilities
- Input and output specifications
- Algorithms and processing logic
- Data structures and schematics
